        <h1> GOAL </h1>
        <p> Approximately 700 million people, or 9.2% of the world's population, live in extreme poverty, according to the most recent statistics on poverty. To be in extreme poverty means to make less than $1.90 a day. About 90% of those living in extreme poverty are found in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, making developing nations home to the majority of this population.

About 1.3 billion people, or 26% of the world's population, live in moderate poverty in addition to those in extreme poverty. The range of $1.90 to $3.20 per day is considered moderate poverty.

Children are disproportionately affected by poverty; children under the age of 18 make up around half of the world's impoverished. The health, education, and general well-being of children are all negatively impacted by poverty (World Poverty Statistics 2024 | Social Income, n.d.). </p>
